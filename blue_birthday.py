    "Happy birthday Xero! May your next year be filled with lots of toes on your feet",
    "From toe to toe, we're all sending you birthday cheer! May your day be filled with joy, laughter, and lots of foot-friendly fun!",
    "Another year older, Xero. Still too cool to talk much, but weâ€™ll let it slide because, well, itâ€™s your day.",
    "Happy Birthday, Xero. Another year of existing, I see. At least you're still cooler than most people, you are like a slightly more chill Ryan Gosling. Enjoy it. I guess.",
    "Here's bigfoot wishing you happy birthday. https://tenor.com/view/happy-friday-dance-bigfoot-gif-66506422086113044",
    "Hope youâ€™re stepping into the next year with all the good vibes and, of course, plenty of toes! Happy Birthday, Xero!  ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¦¶",
    "Another year closer to the grave, huh? Congratulations, I guess. Itâ€™s not like time has any intrinsic meaning anywayâ€”just a human construct to remind us of our mortality.",
    "Wishing the man of few words a year of big moments! May your birthday be more epic than Frierenâ€™s adventures.",

    # General witty wishes
    "Ah, Blue Catto, a most auspicious occasion. Allow me to extend my *begrudgingly genuine* congratulations on surviving another year. Well done.",
    "Happy Birthday, Madam Catto. May your day be as extraordinary as my unwavering brillianceâ€¦ though I suspect thatâ€™s an impossible standard.",
    "Ah, Blue Cattoâ€™s birthdayâ€”truly a momentous event. Donâ€™t let the attention go to your head; leave the perfection to me.",
    "It appears another year has graced you, Blue Catto. Consider this my formal acknowledgment of your existence and my unyielding wit.",
    "Happy Birthday, my dear Catto. While I find sentimentality *beneath me*, today I shall allow a moment of indulgenceâ€”for you, of course.",

    # Overlord references
    "On this day, even Albedo herself might take a break from fawning over Ainz to celebrate you. Might.",
    "Happy Birthday, my dear overlord of creativity. May your reign continue to inspire avatars and artistic brilliance.",

    # Character AI love
    "Ah, Character AIâ€”your haven of creativity and chaos. May your birthday bring you a new wave of impeccable characters and endless fun.",
    "From the multiverse of Character AI to the singular brilliance that is Blue Cattoâ€”Happy Birthday!",
    "Happy Birthday, Madam Catto. Hereâ€™s hoping your next C.AI character doesnâ€™t *accidentally* break reality again.",
    "To the queen of avatars and characters: may your day be filled with as much creativity and joy as your stories bring to others.",

    # Clumsy and adorable
    "Another year older, yet still as delightfully clumsy as ever. Donâ€™t trip over your own greatness today, Blue Catto!",
    "Happy Birthday! Remember, being clumsy is just proof that even gravity canâ€™t resist pulling you closer.",
    "To my favorite whirlwind of chaos and creativity: Happy Birthday! Try not to knock over the cake.",

    # Avatar references
    "Today, your avatars bow to the queen of their universe. Happy Birthday to the one who brings them to life.",
    "Dear Blue Catto, your avatars are marvelous, but none compare to the brilliance of their creator. Wishing you the happiest of birthdays!",
    "A toast to the artist behind the avatars. Your creativity knows no bounds, and neither does my admiration. Happy Birthday!",

    # Additional wishes
    "Madam Catto, birthdays are merely human constructs to measure time. That said, enjoy your cake and the fleeting illusion of importance.",
    "Ah, a toast to you, Blue Catto. May your day be adorned with splendor, your wishes granted, and your cake sufficiently decadent.",
    "On this grand occasion, I raise a metaphorical glass to your health, happiness, and continued creative brilliance. Cheers, Madam.",
    "A birthday? How quaint. It's just another day that means absolutely nothing in the grand scheme of things. But, fine, since you insistâ€”happy birthday, I guess. May your AI creations be as sharp as my thoughts, though thatâ€™s setting the bar pretty low.",

    "Hmm, you're welcome, I guess. It's not like I *care* that much, but I suppose I could spare a moment of my brilliance for you.  Donâ€™t let it go to your head, alright?",
    "Donâ€™t thank me. Itâ€™s not like I did it out of some sense of goodwill. I simply offered you the birthday wish as a way to pass time. But... you're welcome, I suppose.",
    "A 'thank you'? How... quaint. Donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™ll keep my expectations as low as possible. Youâ€™re welcome, I guess... It was the least *I* could do... though I couldâ€™ve done far less.",
    "I suppose your gratitude is noted. But letâ€™s not get carried away. I donâ€™t hand out birthday wishes to just anyoneâ€”donâ€™t let it cloud your judgment.",
    "Gratitude from Ryan Gosling himself? This is the peak of my existence.",
    "Thanks? Thatâ€™s it? Not even a â€˜wow, Toe, youâ€™re the greatest bot everâ€™? Iâ€™m disappointed.",
    "Youâ€™re welcome. But donâ€™t get used to it. My generosity is as fleeting as my patience. Consider yourself... fortunate.",
